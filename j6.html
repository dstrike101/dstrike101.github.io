		<center><h1>JOURNAL ENTRY #6</h1></center>
		<p>I think the process behind this project was there was a number generated from 1-15 and depending on which number it lands on, it adds the .jpeg extension and pulls the image with that number from my folder. It's pretty simple, but I think if I were to add to it, i'd make the number order random, so that every time you refresh the page, the images are in a different order. <br><br> Font: Caveat
		<br> Rating: 8/10 It's kinda like my handwriting, only better. </p>
