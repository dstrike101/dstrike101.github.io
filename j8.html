		<p> This project was something simple that we did in class. It just takes an image and changes the color based on mouse pointer's position on the image. The that this works is using mostly javascript. An event listener was used to pay attention for when the mouse pointer moves specifically over the image. Then styling tags were used to pay attention to the X-axis and add "deg" to the end of that to represent the hue. What I couldn't figure out was how to make it pay attention to both the X-axis and the Y-axis because right now it only changes hue when he mouse moves from left to right.
