		<p>I'm not gonna lie, this project took me awhile to actually get it to semi work. What I did is that I created a div that, when clicked, starts playing the Killuminati instrumental by Joey Bada$$ and when it's clicked again, it pauses. For this one, I had to learn how to use if statements, which I find are actually very easy to use once you get the hang of it. I also made it so that when the music is paused, the div shrinks and the photo changes to the album cover of 2000. <br><br> Font: Rubik Vinyl <br> Rating: 4/10 It just looks like the month of December 2011 if that makes sense. </p>
