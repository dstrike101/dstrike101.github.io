<p> At this point, I've completely redesigned the homepage for my website. Instead of having a random mesmerizing gif on reapeat, I decided to have a snowfall theme. It has taken a bit of work to get it to look like it's falling from the clouds that were added and I'm not exactly finished yet, but it's looking kinda good so far. I think the next thing I need to do is put the text with the link inside the clouds so that the clouds can be closer to the top. I'm still not sure what to do with the third div on the menu bar. <br><br> <strong>Font: Raleway <br> Rating: 6/10 not my favorite</strong></p>
