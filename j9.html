		<p> This project I think I've had the most fun with so far. We were given the task to make a div move when the arrow key was pressed. That part was simple using event listeners and keycodes. What I decided to do next was to make the div in the shape of a car. That was also easy since I just pulled a picture of a car from the internet and converted it to a png. What I found the most fun to do (and the most difficult) was to make the car turn left, right, front, and back. It took me a bit of time to do, but once I sat down understood each part of the code, I figured out how to make the size and image change inside the javascript. I'm sure that there is probably a simpler way that I could've done it, but I'm happy with my results.
