<center><h1>Journal Entry #2</h1></center>
<p> Today, I learned how to put <em>emphasis</em> on a word using the <"em"> tag. I also now know how to <strong>bold certain words</strong> with the <"strong"> tag. Another cool thing I learned is to add line breaks
<br>
<br>
like this. This font is pretty light so it doesn't display them very well but if I do both at once, <em><strong>then it not only becomes visible but intimidating.</strong></em> I think switching up the font for each journal entry would be pretty cool. That way, anytime I need to change the font in the future, I'll have practiced and be able to do it with my eyes closed.</p>
